# Exploring Logistic & Linear Regression, SVM, K-NN, and Neural Networks on Real-World Datasets

This project explores supervised machine learning models across two real world datasets.
The first dataset involves a binary classification task, whether or not a patient has diabetes. The
second dataset involves a regression task, predicting median household values in California
housing districts. This project discusses machine learning algorithms we learned in class, such as
linear regression, logistic regression, SVMs, K-NNs, and neural networks. We will evaluate and
compare these modes based on metrics such as accuracy and root mean squared error.

This was the final project for my Intro to Machine Learning course (CSE 5819) at UConn.
